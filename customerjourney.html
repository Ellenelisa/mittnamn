            <p>In this school project, we developed a comprehensive customer journey focused on a specific target group, which, in our case, was adults with limited financial resources. Our objective was to identify pain points and explore potential enhancements to enhance the overall customer experience. Through this project, we aimed to gain insights into the challenges faced by individuals in this demographic and to propose solutions that could lead to a more positive and efficient customer journey.</p>

These insights enabled us to create a basic persona, allowing us to develop a more informed understanding of our target audience.</p>

        <p class="text">To gather more information about our users' behavior and emotions while they are in a grocery store, we conducted four observational sessions accompanied by complementary semi-structured interviews. This approach allowed us to gain deeper insights into how our users navigate and experience the grocery store environment.</p>
        <p class="text">To ensure that our test subjects were operating under uniform conditions, we developed a checklist for all team members to adhere to during the observation sessions</p>
        <p class="text">During the observation sessions, our team consisted of two key roles: a moderator and an observer. The moderator's responsibility was to document the observations and pose supplementary questions to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the users' behavior. Simultaneously, the observer documented the proceedings to ensure that no crucial details were overlooked during the process.</p>
        <img class="pic1" src="img/intervju_cj.png" alt="Image displaying the interview questions and the checklist to follow during the interview.">
        <p class="text">After completing all the observations, each team member analyzed their respective recordings and created their own individualized customer journey. This approach allowed us to facilitate easy comparison and identify common patterns and elements that were instrumental in developing the final customer journey.</p>
        <p class="text">The steps we used to build our customer journey:</p>
            <p class="textlist"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Activity</span> - What they were doing</p>
            <p class="textlist"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Goal</span> - What they are trying to accomplish</p>
            <p class="textlist"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Picture</span> - Picture that shows the acitivty</p>
            <p class="textlist"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Touchpoint</span> - Where they were located</p>
            <p class="textlist"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Feelings</span> - How they feel in the situation</p>
            <p class="textlist"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Thoughts</span> - What they are thinking in the situation</p>
            <p class="textlist"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Pain points</span> - The aspects that frustuate them</p>
            <p class="textlist"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Improvemnts</span> - Potential improvements to adress the pain points. </p>

        <h3 class="heading">Insights</h3>
        <div class="rectangle"></div>
        <p class="text">The first thing that comes to mind is how challenging it can be to conduct observations, essentially becoming 'the fly on the wall.' The second thing is that it's incredibly rewarding and enlightening. I learned a great deal about my test subject and their behavior by shadowing them in the store. It provided insights that I believe I would never have gained solely through surveys and interviews.
        People often have a perception of what they do and how they behave that doesn't always align with their actual actions in reality.</p>
